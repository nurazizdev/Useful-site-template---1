Besides having both an oncogenic and tumor suppressor function, the intricate role of JMJD10 in cancer is complex as it depends on the cancer type. In particular, the functional role of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer has been poorly understood. In this study, we have unraveled the molecular signatures and functional roles of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer by multiple approaches, i.e., multi-omics bioinformatics study, analysis of human gastric cancer tissues, and studies in vitro using knockdown or overexpression strategies in gastric cancer cell lines. The results indicated that the JMJD10 gene and MINA53 protein are commonly overexpressed in cancer patients. JMJD10/MINA53 is involved in the regulation of proliferation and survival of gastric cancer by controlling cell cycle gene expression. These processes are highly associated with MINA53 enzymatic activity in the regulation of H3K9me3 methylation status and controlling activation of AP-1 signaling pathways. This highlights the oncogenic role of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer and opens the opportunity to develop therapeutic targeting of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer.",tldr,Cancers,Cancers,,Cancers,NA,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/5/1141/pdf?version=1590490889,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/5/1141/pdf?version=1590490889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bibtex,y,y,y,NA,NA,y,NA,NA

A daidzein derivative compound, 8-hydroxydaidzein (8-HD), isolated from soy products, has recently gained attention due to various pharmacological benefits, including anti-inflammatory activities. However, regulation of the inflammatory signaling mechanism for 8-HD is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to the IRF-3 signaling pathway. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of 8-HD in regulating inflammatory processes, with a focus on the IRF-3 signaling pathway using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] stimulated murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). The 8-HD downregulated the mRNA expression level of IRF-3-dependent genes by inhibiting phosphorylation of the IRF-3 transcription factor. The inhibitory mechanism of 8-HD in the IRF-3 signaling pathway was shown to inhibit the kinase activity of IKK&epsilon; to phosphorylate IRF-3. This compound can also interfere with the TRIF-mediated complex formation composed of TRAF3, TANK, and IKK&epsilon; leading to downregulation of AKT phosphorylation and reduction of IRF-3 activation, resulted in inhibition of IRF-3-dependent expression of genes including IFN-&beta;, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1). Therefore, these results strongly suggest that 8-HD can act as a promising compound with the regulatory function of IRF-3-mediated inflammatory responses.",tldr,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,,Biomolecules,NA,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/2/238/pdf?version=1580982364,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/2/238/pdf?version=1580982364,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bibtex,y,y,y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thymoquinone (TQ) is a compound derived from black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) and is known to regulate immune responses by affecting transcription factors associated with inflammation, including nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). However, the role of TQ in the IRF-3 signaling pathway has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of TQ-dependent regulation of enzymes in IRF-3 signaling pathways using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cell line. TQ decreased mRNA expression of the interferon genes IFN-&alpha; and IFN-&beta; in these cells. This inhibition was due to its suppression of the transcriptional activation of IRF-3, as shown by inhibition of IRF-3 PRD (III-I) luciferase activity as well as the phosphorylation pattern of IRF-3 in the immunoblotting experiment. Moreover, TQ targeted the autophosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), an upstream key enzyme responsible for IRF-3 activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that TQ can downregulate IRF-3 activation via inhibition of TBK1, which would subsequently decrease the production of type I IFN. TQ also regulated IRF-3, one of the inflammatory transcription factors, providing a novel insight into its anti-inflammatory activities.",tldr,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,Int. J. Mol.

NA,Review,"Nur Aziz, Mi-Yeon Kim, Jae Youl Cho",2018-05-22,"Anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin: A review of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Luteolin (3', 4', 5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) has been identified as commonly present in plants. Plants with a high luteolin content have been used ethnopharmacologically to treat inflammation-related symptoms. Both isolated luteolin and extracts from luteolin-rich plants have been studied using various models and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper uses recent research findings with a broad range of study models to describe the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin, particularly its mechanisms at the molecular level; provide guidance for future research; and evaluate the feasibility of developing luteolin into an anti-inflammatory drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We summarize reports about the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin published since 2009, which we found in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. To acquire broad information, we extended our search to online FDA documents. RESULTS: Luteolin is a flavonoid commonly found in medicinal plants and has strong anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo. Some of its derivatives, such as luteolin-7-O-glucoside, have also shown anti-inflammatory activity. The action mechanism of luteolin varies, but Src in the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway, MAPK in the activator protein (AP)-?1 pathway, and SOCS3 in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway are its major target transcription factors. A clinical trial with a formulation containing luteolin showed excellent therapeutic effect against inflammation-associated diseases. CONCLUSION: In silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies strongly suggest that the major pharmacological mechanism of luteolin is its anti-inflammatory activity, which derives from its regulation of transcription factors such as STAT3, NF-?B, and AP-1. Much work remains to ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of luteolin before it can be used to treat inflammation-related diseases in humans.",tldr,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,J Ethnopharmacol,,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.05.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.05.019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activity is induced through the interaction of MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3Ks), MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks), and various scaffolding proteins. Because of the importance of the JNK cascade to intracellular bioactivity, many studies have been conducted to reveal its precise intracellular functions and mechanisms, but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this review, we discuss the molecular characterization, activation process, and physiological functions of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), the MAP2K that most specifically controls the activity of JNK.

Luciferase assays, immunoblotting analyses, overexpression strategies, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were performed to identify the molecular mechanisms and targets of Cs-EE. Cs-EE concentration-dependently reduced the secretion of NO and PGE2, inhibited the expression of inflammation-related cytokines in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, and decreased NF-?B- and AP-1-luciferase activity. Subsequently, we determined that Cs-EE decreased the phosphorylation events of NF-?B and AP-1 pathways. Cs-EE treatment also significantly ameliorated the inflammatory symptoms of HCl/EtOH-induced acute gastritis and LPS-induced ALI mouse models. Overexpression of HA-Src and HA-TAK1 along with CETSA experiments validated that inhibited inflammatory responses are the outcome of attenuation of Src and TAK1 activation.

Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity has not been fully investigated. In this study, we elucidated the anti-inflammatory mechanism by focusing on NF-?B signaling, which is considered a prototypical inflammatory signaling pathway in both innate and adaptive immune functions. Cellular activity and the molecular target of Pc-ME were identified in macrophage RAW264.7 cells and HEK293T cells by assessing NO production, cytokine expression by RT-PCR, luciferase gene reporter assay, and protein regulation in cytoplasm by Western blot upon NF-?B activation. Pc-ME reduced NO production without any cell toxicity; inhibited expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as iNOS and IL-6; downregulated NF-?B activation mediated by both MyD88 and TRIF; and diminished the phosphorylation of I?B?, IKK?/?, Akt, p85, Src, and Syk. Pc-ME inhibited Syk and Src autophosphorylation during overexpression in HEK cells, which confirmed our hypothesis that Syk and Src were signaling targets of Pc-ME.

Ex vivo studies showed that Mc-eWE stimulated splenocytes isolated from mice by inducing NO production and expression of immunostimulatory cytokines and by downregulating the expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 without cytotoxicity. In vivo demonstrated that Mc-eWE induced immunostimulation by modulating populations of splenic immune cells, especially by increasing the population of IFN-?+ NK cells.

While spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) are reportedly involved in inflammatory responses in macrophages, their roles and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Methods: Here, the role of the MyD88-Syk axis and the mechanism by which Syk and MyD88 cooperate during macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses are explored using knockout conditions of these proteins and mutation strategy as well as flowcytometric and immunoblotting analyses. Results: Syk rapidly activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and the activation of the NF-?B signaling pathway is abolished in Syk?/?

MyD88 activates Syk and Syk-induced activation of NF-?B signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells but Syk-induced inflammatory responses are significantly inhibited in MyD88?/?

MyD88 interacts with Syk through the tyrosine 58 residue (Y58) in the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of MyD88, leading to Syk activation and Syk-induced activation of the NF-?B signaling pathway. Src activates MyD88 by phosphorylation at Y58 via the Src kinase domain.

The underlying mechanism and the key enzymes responsible for this phenomenon remain largely unknown. In particular, the phenomenon of c-Jun degradation in the inflammatory response has not yet been reported. To verify this, we investigated LPS-stimulated murine macrophages pre-treated with sodium orthovanadate (SO) to uncover the regulatory mechanism of the MAPKs that regulate c-Jun degradation in the inflammatory response. SO suppressed the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. SO also decreased total c-Jun levels without altering the abundance of its mRNA, although phospho-levels of p38, ERK, and JNK were strongly enhanced. By using selective MAPK inhibitors and knockdown and overexpression strategies, p38 was revealed to be a major MAPK that regulates c-Jun degradation. Further analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 is a determinant for c-Jun degradation that is sufficient to induce ubiquitination-dependent c-Jun degradation, recovered by MG132 treatment. Therefore, our results suggest that hyperphosphorylation of p38 by SO contributes to c-Jun degradation linked to the suppression of PGE2 secretion in inflammatory responses; finding drugs to increase p38 activity could be a novel strategy for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs",tldr,BMB Reports,BMB Rep,,BMB Reports,,https://www.bmbreports.org/journal/download_pdf.php?doi=10.5483/BMBRep.2022.55.8.115,https://www.bmbreports.org/journal/download_pdf.php?doi=10.5483/BMBRep.2022.55.8.115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, the corresponding nonhistone protein methyltransferases have been acknowledged in the pathophysiology of cancer. Thus, this study aimed to explore the pathological role of a nonhistone methyltransferase in gastric cancer (GC), identify nonhistone substrate protein, and understand the underlying mechanism. Interestingly, among the 24 methyltransferases and methyltransferase family 16 (MTF16) proteins, EEF1AKMT3 (METTL21B) expression was prominently lower in GC tissues than in normal adjacent tissues and was associated with a worse prognosis. In addition, EEF1AKMT3-knockdown induced gastric tumor invasiveness and migration. Through gain and loss-of-function studies, mass spectrometry analysis, RNA-seq, and phospho-antibody array, we identified EEF1AKMT3 as a novel tumor-suppressive methyltransferase that catalyzes the monomethylation of MAP2K7 (MKK7) at K296, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of TP53. Furthermore, EEF1AKMT3, p-MAP2K7, and TP53 protein levels were positively correlated in GC tissues. Collectively, our results delineate the tumor-suppressive function of the EEF1AKMT3/MAP2K7/TP53 signaling axis and suggest the dysregulation of the signaling axis as potential targeted therapy in GC.",tldr,Cancer Letters,Cancer Letters,,Cancer Letters,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2022.215803,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2022.215803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NA,Research Article,Nur Aziz,2022-11-30,Potential Roles of Methyltransferases Family 16 in Breast Cancer,"Three out of ten members of methyltransferase family 16 (Mtase16) have been separately demonstrated involves in cancer regulation. However, no study has been conducted to elucidate the potential roles of other Mtase16 family members in other types of cancer. This study aims to comprehensively identify the potential cancer regulator of Mtase16 family members in breast cancer adenocarcinoma (BRCA). To investigate the regulatory roles of Mtase16 family members in breast cancer, we employ bioinformatics analysis particularly by looking at the transcriptomic level of these methyltransferases in patients with breast cancer. The clinical relevancies of these methyltransferases were analyzed by survival analysis. Among Mtase16 family members, METTL18 showed upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues in the TCGA-BRCA cohort. Lower survival probability is also being shown in breast cancer patients with high expression of METTL18. These results delineate METTL18 as a potential oncogene in breast cancer and further exploration of the mechanism study will hasten the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein in breast cancer.",tldr,Syntax Literate,Syntax Literate,,Syntax Literate,,https://jurnal.syntaxliterate.co.id/index.php/syntax-literate/article/view/10102/6059,https://jurnal.syntaxliterate.co.id/index.php/syntax-literate/article/view/10102/6059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammation, a vital innate immune response against infection and injury, is mediated by macrophages. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) regulates inflammatory responses in macrophages; however, its role and underlying mechanisms are uncertain. In this study, overexpression and knockout (KO) cell preparations, phagocytosis analysis, confocal microscopy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination, mRNA analysis, and immunoprecipitation/western blotting analyses were used to investigate the role of Syk in phagocytosis and its underlying mechanisms in macrophages during inflammatory responses. Syk inhibition by Syk KO, Syk-specific small interfering RNA (siSyk), and a selective Syk inhibitor (piceatannol) significantly reduced the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells. Syk inhibition also decreased cytochrome c generation by inhibiting ROS-generating enzymes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and ROS scavenging suppressed the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells. LPS induced the tyrosine nitration (N-Tyr) of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) through Syk-induced ROS generation in RAW264.7 cells. On the other hand, ROS scavenging suppressed the N-Tyr of SOCS1 and phagocytosis. Moreover, SOCS1 overexpression decreased phagocytic activity, and SOCS1 inhibition increased the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that Syk plays a critical role in the phagocytic activity of macrophages by inducing ROS generation and suppressing SOCS1 through SOCS1 nitration during inflammatory responses.",tldr,International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology,International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology,,International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03946320221133018,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/03946320221133018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
